## Gameplay

Lanting Housekeeping is a mix of tower defense and roguelike deck-building game. The player has to protect their base, a _rumah lanting_, from enemies that spawn within waves during combat.

The goal is to work through several levels until the player reaches the boss level. Levels are distributed in a branching structure within a map. Levels can be combat encounters, workshops (bengkel), floating markets (pasar terapung), chests, and random encounters.

Combat encounters include one or more waves. Each wave has a variable number of enemies to defeat. Before every wave, the player can play unit cards to place down units that attack enemies automatically. The player can also relocate existing units or return them to the deck. During a wave, enemies spawn from the top of the screen and move toward the rumah lanting near the bottom of the screen. During this time, the player cannot relocate units. Instead, they can only play item cards.

When enemies are defeated, they drop scraps, which are basically energy. Scraps are used to play item cards which have various effects, such as healing damaged units, damaging enemies, and slowing down enemies.

The player wins a combat encounter if they survive all waves within the combat encounter. After every combat encounter, they will be offered an option between 3 random item cards.
